# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Smartwatch demo using LVGL

This code example highlights Infineon's comprehensive support for high-performance and low-power graphics applications on PSOC&trade; Edge MCU.
It showcases a Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation of a smartwatch, primarily using a 1.43-inch round MIPI DSI AMOLED display in 466*466 resolution. It supports following two variants of round AMOLED panels:

**Table 1. Display panel details**

Display MPN | Display details | Manufacturer name | Manufacturer contact details
------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------
1.43” LTPS-AMOLED (Oncell) | 1.43-inch 466x466 AMOLED+CTP MIPI-DSI Display | DAS industry Limited | sales06@das-tek.com <br> Contact person: Yuki Yang <br> https://www.dastek-lcd.com/ <br>
MTZ0143GF01AAA03AV1 | 1.43-inch 466x466 AMOLED+CTP MIPI-DSI Display | Microtech Technology Company Limited | sales11@microtech-lcd.com <br> Contact person: Darcy Wong <br> https://www.microtech-lcd.com/ <br>

This code example also implements the emulation of the round smartwatch GUI in the same resolution on a 4.3-inch MIPI DSI Raspberry Pi DSI display. If you do not have access to the 1.43-inch display, you can run this code example on the 4.3-inch one, which is widely available to purchase from the Raspberry-Pi ecosystem. This application demonstrates the ability to leverage the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for high-performance GUI rendering, as well as a CPU-rendered low-power always-on screen.

> **Note:** This application builds for the 4.3-inch display by default. 

   ```
   CONFIG_DISPLAY=RECTANGLE_4_3_INCH
   ```

   To build the application for aforementioned two different variants of the 1.43-inch display, set the following macro in *common.mk*:

   ```
   CONFIG_DISPLAY=DASTEK_ROUND_1_43_INCH
   ```
   or

   ```
   CONFIG_DISPLAY=MICROTECH_ROUND_1_43_INCH
   ```

Both the displays are interfaced to the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU using Mobile Industry Processor Interface Display Serial Interface (MIPI DSI). The GUI is powered by LVGL and developed using SquareLine Studio UI editor.

   **Figure 1. Block diagram**

**Figure 1** shows the block diagram summarizing the system setup of the smartwatch graphics application. 
The 1.43-inch display is interfaced using one-lane MIPI DSI in command mode whereas the 4.3-inch Raspberry-Pi display is interfaced using one-lane MIPI DSI in video mode.
Configuration data is sent to 4.3-inch display through the I2C lines during initialization.
The touch panel driver ICs of both the displays are interfaced using the I2C protocol for reading the touch coordinates. 
For 1.43-inch display, GPIOs are used for interfacing Interrupt and Reset lines of display and touch panels. 
The 4.3-inch display's touch panel interrupt line is not connected to the PSOC&trade; Edge Evaluation Kit. The touch data is polled by the firmware at regular intervals.
The firmware executes on the CM55 CPU.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Ensure that the 4.3-inch Raspberry-Pi TFT display/1.43-inch AMOLED display is connected to the board as per the [Display setup](#supported-display-and-electrical-connection-with-kit_pse84_eval) section

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

4. In the common makefile - _<application\>/common.mk_, set the value of the `CONFIG_DISPLAY` variable to one of the display options mentioned below to enable the corresponding display and touch drivers for the application. The same information is provided in the comments within the common makefile.

   - **Waveshare 4.3-inch Raspberry Pi DSI LCD Display (MTB_DISPLAY_W4P3INCH) and it's touch panel (MTB_CTP_FT5406):** This is enabled by default<br>
      `RECTANGLE_4_3_INCH`

   - **Dastek 1.43-inch 466*466 round MIPI DSI command mode display (MTB_DISPLAY_CO5300) and it's touch panel (MTB_CTP_FT6146):**<br>
      `DASTEK_ROUND_1_43_INCH` <br> 

   - **Microtech 1.43-inch 466*466 round MIPI DSI command mode display (MTB_DISPLAY_CO5300) and it's touch panel (MTB_CTP_FT3268):**<br>
      `MICROTECH_ROUND_1_43_INCH` <br>

      > **Note:** From the above set, only one display and it's touch driver set should be enabled in the _common makefile_ at a time.

   **Example**:

     - To use the Waveshare 4.3-inch Raspberry Pi DSI LCD display:

       ```
       CONFIG_DISPLAY = RECTANGLE_4_3_INCH
       ```

       or

     - To use the 1.43 inch round display:

       ```
       CONFIG_DISPLAY = DASTEK_ROUND_1_43_INCH
       ```

       or

       ```
       CONFIG_DISPLAY = MICROTECH_ROUND_1_43_INCH
       ```

5. Build the application

6. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Smartwatch Demo using LVGL" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 6. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/tera-term-log.png)

7. The smartwatch application operates in three states - high-performance, low-power, and ultra-low power. <br> For the 1.43-inch round display, the application state is changed from high-performance to low-power and finally to ultra-low power after 30 seconds of inactivity. The application state can be brought back to high-performance by a simple touch activity. <br> For the 4.3-inch display, the state transition is done by pressing the USER BTN1 (SW2) on the kit

8. Observe that on start up, the display shows high-performance GUI for a Smartwatch. You can use the touch screen to perform various actions such as swiping up to see health screen and then music screen, clicking home button to go back to digital clock screen, swiping right to analog clock screen, click weather icon to show weather screen and finally swiping right in weather screen will change to forecast screen. The screenshots of the GUIs are shown in **Figure 7** and **Figure 8**

   ![](images/4_3_inch_hp_ui.png)

   **Figure 8. 1.43-inch high-performance UIs**

   ![](images/1_43_inch_hp_ui.png)

9. For 4.3-inch display, press the user button (SW2) to switch to the low-power state and show the "Always-ON" display. Press the button once again to enter the ultra-low power state and turn off the display

   **Figure 9. 4.3-inch Always-ON UI**

   ![](images/4_3_inch_always_on_ui.png)

10. For 1.43-inch, after 30 seconds of inactivity, the application state changes to low-power state and the "Always-ON" GUI of the Smartwatch is displayed as shown in **Figure 10**. After further 30 seconds of inactivity, the device enters the ultra-low power and the display is turned off

    **Figure 10. 1.43-inch Always-ON UI**
