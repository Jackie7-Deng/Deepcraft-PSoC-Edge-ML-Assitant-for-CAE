# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Machine Learning – DEEPCRAFT&trade; data collection

This code example demonstrates how to collect data by implementing the [DEEPCRAFT&trade; streaming protocol v2](https://developer.imagimob.com/getting-started/tensor-streaming-protocol/registering-sensors-using-protocolv2) for PSOC&trade; Edge E84 MCU boards, allowing the streaming of sensor data and other information from the board into [DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio](https://www.imagimob.com/products) over USB for development and testing of Edge AI models.

The code example supports collecting data from different sources utilizing the Cortex&reg;-M55 (CM55) CPU, data can be collected from an inertial measurement unit (IMU - BMI270), magnetometer (BMM350), XENSIV&trade; digital MEMS microphones (IM73D122V01) using pulse-density modulation (PDM) to pulse-code modulation (PCM), XENSIV&trade; digital barometric air pressure sensor (DPS368), digital humidity and temperature sensor (SHT40), and XENSIV&trade; 60 GHz radar sensor (BGT60TR13C). The data is transmitted using USB to [DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio](https://www.imagimob.com/products). The data can then be used in [DEEPCRAFT&trade; starter projects](https://developer.imagimob.com/getting-started/starter-project) or to generate a new model. 

To deploy a DEEPCRAFT&trade; model onto an Infineon embedded device, see the following code examples:

- [mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-audio](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-audio)
- [mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-motion](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-motion)
- [mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-radar](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-radar)

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

> **Note:** DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio currently support only the Windows system.

 Kit  |  USB connector
:-------- | :-------------
`KIT_PSE84_AI` | J2
`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2` | J30
`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4` | J30

<br>


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

- Install [DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio](https://www.imagimob.com/studio) if not already installed
- Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html)


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Firmware Debug Console" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

### Data collection with DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio
 
**Table 1. Sensors available on kit**

Kit  |  Available sensors
:-------- | :-------------
`KIT_PSE84_AI` | Inertial measurement unit (BMI270), magnetometer (BMM350), XENSIV&trade; digital MEMS microphones (IM73D122V01), XENSIV&trade; digital barometric air pressure sensor (DPS368), digital humidity and temperature sensor (SHT40), and XENSIV&trade; 60 GHz RADAR sensor (BGT60TR13C) 
`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2` | Inertial measurement unit (BMI270), magnetometer (BMM350), XENSIV&trade; digital MEMS microphones (IM73D122V01)
`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4` | Inertial measurement unit (BMI270), magnetometer (BMM350), XENSIV&trade; digital MEMS microphones (IM73D122V01)

> **Note:** <br>
      For step-by-step instructions on collecting data on `KIT_PSE84_AI` and `KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2` / `KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4` kit, see DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio getting started section for [KIT_PSE84_AI](https://developer.imagimob.com/deepcraft-studio/getting-started/infineon-boards/psoc-edge-e84-ai-kit) , [ KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/EPC4](https://developer.imagimob.com/deepcraft-studio/getting-started/infineon-boards/psoc-edge-e84-eval-kit) kit respectively. <br>


> **Note:**
    To ensure the optimal performance and the data integrity when working with sensors, consider the following guidelines:<br>
    <b>1. Enabling Sensors:</b> When enabling all sensors simultaneously, it is recommended to initialize them with their default frequency or minimum frequency. This helps prevent potential data loss due to excessive data streams. By starting with a minimal data frequency, you can ensure that the DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio runs smoothly.<br>
    <b>2. Sensor Readings:</b> 
    <br> a. The sensor readings are relative to the board temperature and not relative to the ambient temperature. Since KIT_PSE84_AI has a smaller form-factor, it generates more heat on the board compared to KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2 / KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4. Therefore, you may notice a slight difference in the sensor readings between these kits. Care must be taken when porting the models the across the boards to compensate any deviation in the sensor readings.
    <br> b. By default, the orientation of the BMI270 and BMM350 sensors is aligned with the PSOC&trade; 6 AI Evaluation Kit (CY8CKIT-062S2-AI). To disable this alignment, set the `SENSOR_REMAPPING` macro to `DISABLED` in the common.mk file.

## Status LED codes


### Normal operation

The status LED1 indicates that normal operation by flashing each time data is sent. If data is being sent at a high frequency, the LED may appear dimmed due to the rapid flashing.


### Error indication

In the event of an error, the LED1 will flash a specific error code. Each flash pattern consists of short and long flashes:
- A short flash (noted as `.`) lasts 100 milliseconds
- A long flash (noted as `-`) lasts 300 milliseconds

The sequence repeats after a delay of 3 seconds.


### Error code patterns

**Table 2. Error code patterns**

Pattern  |  Error description
:-------- | :-------------
`-    (repeated without pause)`| The wrong USB port is connected or failed to establish USB connection. Check the USB cable
`-.   (pause, repeated)`| Unspecified error
`.-   (pause, repeated)`| UART error. Data communication error
`-..  (pause, repeated)`| I2C bus error
