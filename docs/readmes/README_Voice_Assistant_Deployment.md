# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: DEEPCRAFT&trade; Voice Assistant deployment

This code example demonstrates how to use PSOC&trade; Edge MCU to deploy DEEPCRAFT&trade; Voice Assistant (VA) models to detect wake words and spoken commands using natural language.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

> **Note:**
> 1. The Audio and Voice middleware included in this example has a limited operation of about 15 and 30 minutes. For the unlimited license, contact Infineon support
> 2. This code example supports only the Arm&reg; and LLVM compilers, which need to be installed separately. See the *Software Setup* section below

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.6 or later (tested with v3.6)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 AI Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_AI) (`KIT_PSE84_AI`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position

> **Note:** This hardware setup is not required for KIT_PSE84_AI.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

Install [Arm&reg; Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) toolchain. Note that an Arm&reg; account and license is required for this compiler. Alternatively, install [LLVM compiler](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases/tag/release-19.1.5), which does not require a license.

Depending on your choice of compiler (Arm, LLVM), set these env variables or set in common_app.mk with the path.
- Arm Compiler for Embedded <br>
CY_COMPILER_ARM_DIR=[path to Arm compiler installation] <br>
For example: C:/Program Files/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22

- LLVM compiler <br>
CY_COMPILER_LLVM_ARM_DIR=[path to LLVM compiler location] <br>
For example: C:/llvm/LLVM-ET-Arm-19.1.5-Windows-x86_64

If you like to customize the wake word and the spoken commands, you need to have access to the [DEEPCRAFT&trade; Voice-Assistant Cloud tool](https://deepcraft.infineon.com/solutions/voice-assistant) and create your own wake word and spoken commands.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: Voice Assistant Deploy Demo" message is printed on the UART terminal. The kit's blue LED shall be ON, indicating the user to speak the wake word.

4. Speak the wake word "OK Infineon" and one of the commands from this [list](./proj_cm55/va_models/Smart_Lights_Demo/command_list_Smart_Lights_Demo.txt). To change the wake word and commands, see the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) section. Note that after speaking the wake word, the kit's blue LED keeps breathing till a timeout occurs or a command is spoken.

5. Confirm that the command is printed correctly in the terminal

6. To customize the wake word and commands, use the [DEEPCRAFT&trade; Voice-Assistant Cloud tool](https://deepcraft.infineon.com/solutions/voice-assistant) to generate new code to be used in the application. Copy the generated files to the *proj_cm55/va_models* folder and update `DEEPCRAFT_PROJECT_NAME` in the *common.mk* file to the project name used in the cloud tool. Re-program the board and test the new wake word and commands

7. The code example comes with the `LED_Demo` DEEPCRAFT&trade; project example, which controls the kit's green LED and prints the list of commands supported on the terminal. Set `DEEPCRAFT_PROJECT_NAME` to `LED_Demo` in the *common.mk* file to use this project, build and program it. Follow the instructions printed in the terminal.

> **Note:** Only the `LED_Demo` project prints the list of commands in the terminal. Any other project needs to refer to the text file listing all commands that come with the generated model.
